---Accessing the site---
1. In your terminal, make sure the directory is correct 
& enter the following command: npm run watch. 
2. In your browser bar enter "localhost:3000/" followed by the relevant page in order to access.

---Local Pathing---
When performing pathing for links / sources that are within the codebase,
bare in mind that all links are relational to the /public/ folder
due to how express has been initialised & setup in app.js
